      <h1>Real Estate</h1>
      <p>
      Real estate is property consisting of land and the buildings on it, along with its natural resources such as crops, minerals or water; immovable property of this nature; an interest vested in this an item of real property, buildings or housing in general.
      The most common way to sell a home, used in 90% of sales, is to use a local real estate agent. 1 The agent will list the home, market it, and coordinate showings with other agents and potential buyers. They will also help you evaluate offers, negotiate terms with the buyer, and ensure the deal goes through.
      During an open house, a seller's real estate agent or broker holds open hours during which the home is available for the public to view. Potential buyers may drop by anytime within the scheduled hours, without an appointment.
