<h3 style="color:PaleVioletRed;">My Poem</h3>

<p style="color:Thistle;">Leaves are falling to the ground<br>I can't hear not one sound<br>The days are getting shorter<br>The nights are getting longer</p>

<p style="color:Thistle;">The leaves are falling off the trees<br>Soon as you step outside you feel a cool breeze<br>I look out the window and say goodnight<br>I guess the cold is alright.</p>
